# To-Do List
Code Explanation:

Let’s follow the same drill and break down the main parts of this C++ project to understand what’s happening:

The program starts by including the necessary headers for file and string handling and the vector container.
The showTasks function is used to display the current tasks.
The main function reads existing tasks from a file, tasks.txt, into a vector.
The user is prompted to add a task or view the current tasks.
New tasks entered by the user are added to the vector.
When the user quits, tasks are written back to tasks.txt, saving them for future sessions.
When you run this program, you’ll see a simple user interface that allows you to add tasks to your to-do list or view the current list.

We’ve also included an option to quit the program, which results in your tasks being saved to a text file. 

Overall, this C++ project is great for getting to grips with basic file operations, dynamic data handling using vectors, and simple program flow control in C++.

How would you alter this C++ program? Maybe you can add some more fields, like dates and times for to-dos? Perhaps you could even investigate a search function that uses keywords?

Get creative, as that’s the best way to flex your C++ programming muscles while also cementing these new skills
